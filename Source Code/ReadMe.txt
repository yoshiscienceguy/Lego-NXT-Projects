Guitar Challenge Game Project - NXT Programs
============================================
The NXT programs for the Guitar Challenge Game project (Game Mode)
are written in NXC, which is a C-like language for the NXT.
An editor and compiler for NXC is available for free at:

    GuitarShared.nxc - Shared code which is automatically included 
                       by both GuitarGame and GuitarRecord
