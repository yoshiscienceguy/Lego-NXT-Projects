		<p><font size="2">Overall there are two modes that you can use the 
		guitar in: <a href="#GameMode">Game Mode</a> and <a href="#FreePlay">
		Free Play</a> mode.&nbsp; In both modes, you choose a note to play by 
		sliding the flat plate along the neck of the guitar with your left hand 
		to select the note to play, then press the strum lever with your right 
		thumb or fingers to play the note.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2">If the guitar was made with two touch sensors, the 
		strum lever will trigger on both up and down strokes, otherwise only on 
		down strokes.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2"><b>Important: </b>For best results, be sure to keep your left hand 
		completely behind the sliding plate, so that the ultrasonic sensor sees 
		only the plate and not your hand, as shown below:</font></p>

		<p><font size="2">In Game Mode, you are challenged to play along with 
		notes that are scrolling downward on the NXT screen, optionally 
		listening to the song from an external source such as a stereo or iPod.&nbsp; 
		For the Game Mode programs you will want the NXT brick separated from 
		the body of the guitar as shown in the main <a href="steps.html">

		<p><font size="2">In Game Mode, the NXT doesn't play the notes of the 
		music.&nbsp; The game is designed to allow you to listen to the &quot;real&quot; 
		music on your stereo or iPod and play along with it.&nbsp; The only 
		sound coming from the NXT will be short beeps when you miss notes.</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Arial"><b><a name="SongFiles"></a>Song Data Files</b></font></h4>
		<p><font size="2">The songs that you play are stored in data files on 
		the NXT, with a separate data file for each song.&nbsp; You can get song 
		data files onto your NXT in four ways:</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">You can download the 
			data files for the sample songs provided below to the NXT.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">You can record your own 
			songs by &quot;playing along&quot; with your own favorite music using the <b>
			GuitarRecord</b> NXT song recording program.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Owners of the CD can use the PC (Windows) song recording program 
			to record and edit their own songs on a PC using the keyboard and 
			mouse.&nbsp; This provides a much easier and more accurate way to 
			record your own songs than using the NXT to record.&nbsp; This also 
			allows you to label your songs with artist, song, and album titles, 
			reset high scores, and edit/change the recorded notes.</font></li>
			<li><font size="2">Owners of the CD also have access to additional 
			song files submitted by other owners of the game.&nbsp; For more 
			information, see <a href="#Upgrade">Program Upgrades and Accessing 
			Additional Song Files</a>. </font></li>
		</ol>
		<h4><b><font face="Arial"><a name="Downloading"></a>Downloading the Game 
		Mode Programs and Sample Songs</font></b></h4>
		<p><font size="2">The NXT programs for Game Mode were written in NXC, 
		which is a programming language that provides lower-level access to the 
		NXT's capabilities and more speed than the standard NXT-G programming 
		system.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the programs needed will not load and download in 
		the same way as other NXT programs on this CD.&nbsp; To load the 
		programs and sample songs, do the following:</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Make a folder on your 
			computer where you will keep the programs and song data files.&nbsp; 
			For example, on Windows, you might make a folder under &quot;My 
			Documents&quot; named &quot;NXT Guitar Game&quot;.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Download the programs 
			and song files that you want from the table below, and save the 
			downloaded files in the folder you created in step 1.<br>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">To record your own songs on 
		the NXT, run the <b>GuitarRecord</b> program on the NXT.&nbsp; The song 
		will start recording as soon as you strum the first note, and stop

		</font></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">In Game Mode there are five

		You can &quot;play&quot; whatever notes (positions) you want, and your note 
		selection and timing will be recorded.&nbsp; No sound will be played by 
		the NXT.&nbsp; Recording is designed to synchronize along with external 
		music that you are listening to on your stereo or iPod (or you can just 
		play to an imaginary song from memory if you want).</font></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">&nbsp;When listening to 
		music that you want to synchronize the song with, a good strategy is:</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Start the <b>
			GuitarRecord</b> program and get ready to play.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Start the song on your 
			stereo or iPod.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Wait for a logical 
			place near the beginning of the song to start your first note.&nbsp; 
			It shouldn't be right at the beginning, because this will be too 
			hard to anticipate when playing back.&nbsp; Give yourself the 
			opportunity to hear the tempo and start the first note in a logical 
			place that will be easy to anticipate when playing back.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Play your first note at 
			the right time, then choose and play more notes in sync with the 
			music.&nbsp; Hold the strum button down to make long notes.&nbsp; 
			The whammy bar doesn't do anything in Game Mode.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Press the Enter button 
			on the NXT when done recording.&nbsp; The song will be given a data 
			file name something like &quot;Song xx&quot;.&nbsp; The Artist and Song title 
			information will be filled in to indicate the NXT recorder. </font>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><b><font face="Arial"><a name="Playing">
		</a>Playing Songs on the NXT</font></b></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">To play the guitar game on 
		the NXT, run the <b>GuitarGame</b> program on the NXT and choose the 
		song to play using the NXT buttons.&nbsp; When you get to the game 
		display with the &quot;fret strings&quot;, the song will start playing as soon as 
		you strum the first note.&nbsp; So, if you are playing along with 
		external music:</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Get the song ready to 
			play in the <b>GuitarGame</b> program</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Start the song on your 
			stereo or iPod.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Play the start of the 
			first note at the correct time.&nbsp; You will need to know when the 
			first recorded note of the song is in order to anticipate it and 
			play it at the right time.&nbsp; If you play the first note at the 
			wrong time, all of the notes in the song will be displayed out of 
			synch with the music.&nbsp; For songs you recorded, you will need to 
			remember where the first note is.&nbsp; For the sample songs and 
			songs you record on the PC, the song will specify the approximate 
			starting time of the first note in seconds from the beginning of the 
			song.&nbsp; For example, if the song says to start 0:08, then the 
			first game note will be approximately 8 seconds from the very 
			beginning of the song.&nbsp; Note that this time is approximate, the 
			exact time will be in sync with a logical/clear guitar note in the 
			song. </font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">At the end of the 
			recorded notes, your number of missed notes and score (percent 
			correct) will be displayed.&nbsp; If you beat the best high score

				<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Here are some hints 
				for editing songs on the PC using the <b>GuitarRecorder</b> 
				program:</font></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">You have five 
					note positions to work with.&nbsp; Come up with a basic plan 
					for how you will use the five notes for a section in the 
					song and practice it a bit on the keys before recording it.
					</font></p></li>
					<li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">You can record 
					a song in sections if you use reference points in the song 
					for where to restart the recording timer.&nbsp; This allows 
					you to plan and re-try certain portions until you get them 
					close enough to fine tune edit by hand.&nbsp; Here is how:</font></p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">After 
						recording one section, stop the timer with the Space 
						bar.</font></p></li>
						<li>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Scroll back 
						to a reference point in the music graph that you know, 
						using the scroll bar and arrow keys.&nbsp; For example, 
						in the picture to the right, the song has been stopped 
						and scrolled back to the beginning of a recognizable 
						note at the beginning of a beat, which is at about 2:08 
						in the song.</font></p></li>
						<li>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Rewind your 
						music player to before the reference point (e.g. a few 
						second before 2:08 in this example).</font></p></li>
						<li>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Listen for 
						the reference point in the music (near 2:08), then press 
						the Space bar exactly at the reference point to restart 
						the timer and start recording again. </font></p></li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">To erase 
					portions of a song before re-recording them, start the 
					timer, then press and hold the 0 (zero) key to erase notes 
					at the recording point.</font></p></li>
					<li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">You can fine 
					tune and fix minor errors in the recording using the mouse 
					when the timer is stopped&nbsp; Click and drag with the left 
					button to &quot;draw&quot; a note on a string, and click and drag with 
					the right button to erase notes.</font></p></li>
					<li>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Remember to 
					save a song after editing it.</font></p></li>

		<p><font size="2">In Free Play mode, you can install the NXT brick into 
		the body of the guitar as shown above to make it more portable (see the 
		Free Play <a href="steps.html#FreePlay">conversion instructions</a>), or 
		you can leave the NXT outside as in Game Mode so that you can see the 
		tone graph drawn by the Free Play mode programs.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">There are two Free Play 
		programs that give you two different variations:</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">The 
			<a href="../programs/GuitarFreeTones.rbt">GuitarFreeTones</a> 
			program plays tones for the notes using the NXT's tone generator.&nbsp; 
			When playing tones, you can hold the strum lever down to hold a long 
			note.&nbsp; You can also use the &quot;whammy bar&quot; to add whammy effects 
			to a long tone.&nbsp; To use the whammy bar, position the whammy bar 
			angled against its rubber support, strum and hold a note with your 
			thumb, then push the whammy bar down and up with your fingers or 
			palm (towards the light sensor) <i>after</i> strumming the note.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">The 
			<a href="../programs/GuitarFreeChord.rbt">GuitarFreeChord</a> program will play some 
			cool recorded guitar “power chord” sounds to make your electric 
			guitar sound more realistic. However, to use this program, you will 
			<b>first</b> need to copy some recorded guitar chord sound files to the NXT 
			Sounds folder on your computer as described in the next section 
			below.<br>
			<br>
			In addition to needing the guitar sound files, the
			<a href="../programs/GuitarFreeChord.rbt">GuitarFreeChord</a> 
			program has a few other restrictions that 
			you should know about:</font><ul>
				<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">The recorded guitar 
				chord sounds take a lot of memory on the NXT, so you may need to 
				delete other programs that you have downloaded to your NXT to 
				make room. And when you are done using the guitar and need more 
				memory for other programs, you should delete the sound files 
				from the NXT.</font></li>
				<li>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Due to memory constraints, the guitar chords 
				will only play for about ½ second for each press, so you can‘t 
				hold long notes. Use it like a “rhythm guitar” and keep 
				strumming!</font></li>
				<li><font size="2">The whammy bar doesn't do anything when 
				playing chords.</font></li>
			</ul></li>
		</ol>
		<h4><font face="Arial"><a name="ChordSounds"></a>Copying the Guitar 
		Chord Sounds to the NXT</font></h4>
		<p><font size="2">Before you can download and use the
		<a href="../programs/GuitarFreeChord.rbt">GuitarFreeChord</a> program, 
		you need to copy the special guitar chord sounds to a location on your 
		computer where the NXT software can find them.&nbsp; To do this:</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Locate and open the 
				NXT Sounds folder on your computer. On most computers, this is:<br>
			<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows:</b> <i>C:\Program Files\LEGO Software\LEGO MINDSTORMS

			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Open the package of
				<a href="../sounds/Guitar_Chord_Sounds.zip">Guitar Chord 
				Sounds</a> (a .zip file) and open it to locate 
				the eight guitar sound (.rso) files.&nbsp; If your computer 
				cannot open .zip files, you can download the eight sound files 
				individually from <a href="../sounds/guitar/">here</a>.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Copy (select and drag) all eight of the

		<h4><font face="Arial"><a name="FreePlay_Hints"></a>Hints for using the 
		Guitar in Free Play mode</font></h4>
		<p><font size="2">Playing music in Free Play mode is tricky and takes 
		some practice.&nbsp; The ultrasonic sensor is very sensitive to the 
		exact position of the fret slider.&nbsp; Here are a few tips:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Make sure your left 
			hand is positioned behind the slider, so that the ultrasonic sensor 
			sees only the sliding flat plate, not your hand.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Slight changes in the 
			angle of the sliding flat plate can cause the note to change.&nbsp; 
			It helps to apply a slight twisting pressure to the plate in one 
			direction so that its angle does not &quot;chatter&quot; around from side to 
			side.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Experiment to find the 
			positions of the 8 notes.&nbsp; Adjust the slider stopper pegs if 
			necessary.&nbsp; Then watch the fret board to hit the positions you 
			remember.&nbsp; Better yet, insert pegs into the neck of the guitar 
			at the right locations to mark the center of each note position.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">When playing a note, 
			stop the previous note, then quickly move the slider into position 
			for the next note slightly before the note and get it to stop as 
			fast as possible, then strum the note at the right time.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">You will not be able to 
			play all notes, only the 8 notes from the <a href="#Notes">Blues 
			Scale</a> as shown below.&nbsp; You will have to experiment to see 
			which tunes this will allow you to play.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Practice very easy 
			tunes first and slowly work your way up to harder tunes.</font></li>
