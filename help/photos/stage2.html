<table border="0" width="740">
	<tr>
		<td><font size="2">To get beyond the results of the
		<a href="stage1.html">Stage 1</a> fixes, we need to start taking 
		pictures without using the flash, in order to control the lighting 
		better.&nbsp; In addition, we will want to adjust the camera settings to 
		use a very narrow lens opening (high f-stop number) to get sharper focus 
		and better details.&nbsp; However, the combination of these two means 
		that the camera will require a long exposure (shutter speed) in order to 
		get enough light, and this will require using a tripod to hold the 
		camera steady enough so that the picture will not be blurred.</font><p>
		<font size="2">To be able to use the right camera settings for this 
		stage, your camera must have some degree of manual control over the 
		exposure.&nbsp; See the <a href="cameras.html">Camera Requirements</a> 
		for details.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2">The improvements at this level have mainly to do with 
		getting sharpness and fine detail.&nbsp; If all you want to do is take a 
		single picture of your whole robot to post to the web in a size small 
		enough for a typical web photo, then you probably don't need to bother 
		with this, and the <a href="stage1.html">Stage 1</a> improvements are 
		probably enough.&nbsp; However, if you want to post a high-resolution 
		picture, or crop down to make a close-up (such as in the building 
		instructions on <a href="../../index.html">nxtprograms.com</a>), then a 
		tripod will help a lot, as shown in the comparison below, which shows a 
		small portion cropped out of the full-resolution photos.<br>

		You will also notice from this comparison that the SLR takes 
		significantly sharper and cleaner photos than the point and shoot 
		camera.&nbsp; This is not due to a difference in the resolution 
		(although the D200 has 10 Megapixels and the A570 has 7 Megapixels, the 
		zoom was slightly different in these shots, so that the resulting 
		resolution of this cropped portion is almost the same), but rather due 
		to the much larger sensor of an SLR, which results in a significantly 
		better signal-to-noise ratio of the light at the sensor.&nbsp; So

		However, there are a couple of problems with using only the room lights.&nbsp; 
		First, the robot is lit mostly from the top, which makes the lower 
		portions hard to see, and there are a lot of shadows.&nbsp; Second, as a 
		practical matter, this photo required a 15 second (!) exposure, which is 
		long enough to be annoying if you have several pictures to take.&nbsp; 
		So, if you have some external lights, such as desk lamps, you can use 
		them to light up the model to improve these problems.</font><p>
		<font size="2">To eliminate as many shadows and dark areas as possible,

	<tr>
		<td><font size="2">If you don't have three external lights or don't want 
		to bother setting them all up, here is a trick you can use to get pretty 
		good results with a single external light.&nbsp; If you just set up a 
		single light shining at the robot from one angle, it would only be lit 
		from one side and have huge shadows on the other side.&nbsp; However, 
		using a single desk lamp in addition to the room lights, the exposure in 
		this case will still take 8 seconds to get enough light.&nbsp; So, you 
		can take a single desk lamp, hold it in your hand, and move the light 
		around during the 8 seconds of exposure time to help light up all areas 
		of the robot.&nbsp; In the result below, I slowly panned the light in a 
		half circle from the right side to the front then to the left side. 
		Using this technique, you could even linger a little longer on the dark 
		areas or areas that you want to call attention to in order to light them 
		up a little better.<br>

		Unfortunately, your automatic camera, smart as it is, does not know that 
		it is on a tripod (hmm, what if there was a touch sensor in the tripod 
		mount hole?...).&nbsp; So, if you turn the flash off, then in an attempt 
		to get a short enough shutter speed for non-blurry photos, the camera 
		will make a number of choices that are not what we want for good tripod 
		photos, so we will need to manually change these settings.</font><ul>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">First of all, when 
			taking pictures indoors, the camera will normally want to flash, so 
			you have to set the flash to &quot;<b>No Flash</b>&quot;.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">As in the
			<a href="stage1.html">Stage 1</a> fixes, you want the camera to be 
			about <b>3 feet away</b> from the robot, using the optical zoom to 
			make the robot fill the frame.&nbsp; This will be approx a <b>3x 
			zoom</b>. </font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">To maximize light, the 
			camera will normally try to open the lens all the way (lowest f-stop 
			number).&nbsp; However, we actually want the highest f-stop number 
			that the camera can do in order to get good focus across the whole 
			model (good
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field">depth of field</a>).&nbsp; 
			So, we need to manually set the f-stop.&nbsp; On the Canon A570, you 
			can use <b>Aperture Priority mode</b> and set the f-stop to <b>f/8</b> 
			(as high as allowed).</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Given that we set the 
			f-stop to f/8, in order to try to get a shorter shutter speed, the 
			camera will try to boost the ISO sensitivity of the sensor, which 
			will make the picture grainy.&nbsp; To prevent this, we need to set 
			the ISO sensitivity to its lowest value instead of &quot;automatic&quot;.&nbsp; 
			For the Canon A570, this is <b>ISO 80</b>.</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">Depending on your 
			camera and the kind of light bulbs you are using in your external 
			lights, the camera may or may not guess the correct &quot;white balance&quot; 
			for this kind of lighting.&nbsp; To make sure, when using 
			incandescent lights as in this example, set the white balance to &quot;<b>Tungsten</b>&quot; 
			(or &quot;Incandescent&quot; -- they mean the same thing).</font></li>
			<li>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">With all these

			more), which is fine on a tripod.&nbsp; However, at this speed, 
			pressing the button to take the picture will bump the camera 
			slightly which will blur the photo.&nbsp; So to get around this, use 
			the self-timer feature of the camera to make a delay between when 
			you press the button and when the picture is taken.&nbsp; The 
			typical use of the self-timer is to allow you time to run around and 
			get in the picture yourself, and a typical delay for this purpose is 
			10 sec, but if your camera allows a <b>2 second self-timer delay</b>, 
			then you can use that instead to get it over with faster.</font></li>

			So, we need to manually set the f-stop.&nbsp; An f-stop of <b>f/16</b> 
			is good for this purpose.&nbsp; Many SLR lenses can go even farther 
			(e.g. f/22 or higher), but going this far can actually cause the photo to 
			start losing detail due to diffraction effects.&nbsp; To set the

			in a very grainy looking picture.&nbsp; The sharpest pictures are 
			achieved at the lowest sensitivity settings, which for an SLR should 
			be around ISO 100.&nbsp; To force ISO 100 on the Nikon D200, you need to <b>
			turn &quot;Auto ISO&quot; off</b>, which is buried down in the camera menus,

			<p style="margin-bottom: 6px"><font size="2">If you chose Aperture

			robots (being conservative to make sure it does not overexpose the 
			white areas), so you can either <b>add Fill Light later</b> in a
			<a href="stage1.html#editing">digital photo editing</a> program, or 
			use the Exposure Compensation control to force a longer exposure by 
			asking for a compensation of something like EV +1.&nbsp; If you 
			choose Manual mode then you can increase the shutter speed yourself 
			until the light meter shows +1 or whatever you find gives the best
